## Flickr Photo Search

Some services provide search features and give you a lot of control over the results you get back. All you have to do is construct the right kind of request.

Create a program with a graphical interface that takes in a search string and displays photographs that match that search string. Use Flickr ’s public photo feed at https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_private/ as your service.

### Example Output

Your program should display the photographs like this:

![Flickr Photo Search](flickr-photo-search.png)

### Constraints

- Because this is a graphical program, you’ll need to display the pictures from the API. If you’re using JavaScript, do this with HTML and the DOM. Don’t use jQuery or any external frameworks. If you’re using Java, try building a desktop application with Swing or an Android application. If you’re using a language without a rich GUI toolkit, create an HTML page and open it with the local browser.

## Grabbing the Weather

Is it nice out today? Or should I grab my coat?

Using the OpenWeatherMap API at http://openweathermap.org/current, create a program that prompts for a city name and returns the current temperature for the city.

### Example Output

```
Where are you? Chicago IL
Chicago weather:
65 degrees Fahrenheit
```

### Constraint

* Keep the processing of the weather feed separate from the part of your program that displays the results.

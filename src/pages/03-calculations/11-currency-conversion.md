## Currency Conversion

At some point, you might have to deal with currency exchange rates, and you’ll need to ensure your calculations are as precise as possible.

Write a program that converts currency. Specifically, convert euros to U.S. dollars. Prompt for the amount of money in euros you have, and prompt for the current exchange rate of the euro. Print out the new amount in U.S. dollars. The formula for currency conversion is

where

- `amount to` is the amount in U.S. dollars.
- `amount from` is the amount in euros.
- `rate from` is the current exchange rate in euros.
- `rate to` is the current exchange rate of the U.S. dollar.

### Example Output

```
How many euros are you exchanging? 81
What is the exchange rate? 137.51
81 euros at an exchange rate of 137.51 is 111.38 U.S. dollars.
```

### Constraints

- Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
- Use a single output statement.
